# Industrial_Copper_Modeling
Overview :

This project helps to predict the selling price through Streamlit. 

Features :

Data Collection: collected the given data. 

Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data for analysis. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth analysis and visualization of Copper data set. 

Interactive Streamlit UI: Developed a user-friendly interface for data exploration, presentation and for the price and status prediction.

Classification:
- Success and Failure Classification: Focusing on 'Won' and 'Lost' status.
- Algorithm Assessment: Evaluating algorithms for classification.
- Algorithm Selection: Choosing the Random Forest Classifier.


Regression:
- Algorithm Assessment: Identifying algorithms for regression.
- Algorithm Selection: Opting for the Random Forest Regressor.
